# Responsive-credit-card-form-using-CSS-grid

Solution to project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw/hub/interactive-card-details-form-BrUGKFPEM4) using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Layout is largely determined by nested grids. Would appreciate feedback on grid usage. I typically stick to using flexbox but decided to use grid because the layout seemed more rigid.
